	author = {Oren Etzioni and Kobi Reiter and Stephen Soderl and Marcus Sammer},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {We introduce a novel approach to the task of lexical translation. We utilize the translation graph, a massive lexical resource where each node denotes a word in some language and each edge denotes a word sense shared by a pair of words. Our current graph contains 1,267,460 nodes and 2,315,783 edges. The graph is automatically constructed from machine-readable dictionaries and Wiktionaries. Paths through the graph suggest word translations absent from any of the input dictionaries. We define a probabilistic inference procedure that enables us to quantify our confidence in a translation derived from the graph, and thus trade precision against recall. We demonstrate the graph’s utility by employing it in the PANIMAGES cross-lingual image search engine. Google retrieves images based on the words in their “vicinity”, which limits the ability of a searcher to retrieve them. Although images are universal, an English searcher will fail to find images tagged in Chinese, and conversely. PANIMAGES addresses this problem by translating and disambiguating queries, using the translation graph, before sending them to Google. Our experiments show that, for queries in “minor ” languages, PANIM-AGES increases the number of correct images in the first 15 pages of results by 75\%. 1},

  abstract = {WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.

The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.}

Abstract =    {Computing semantic relatedness of natural language texts requires access to vast
         amounts of common-sense and domain-specific world knowledge. We propose
         Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), a novel method that represents the meaning of
         texts in a high-dimensional space of concepts derived from Wikipedia. We use
         machine learning techniques to explicitly represent the meaning of any text as
         a weighted vector of Wikipedia-based concepts. Assessing the relatedness of
         texts in this space amounts to comparing the corresponding vectors using
         conventional metrics (e.g., cosine). Compared with the previous state of the
         art, using ESA results in substantial improvements in correlation of computed
         relatedness scores with human judgments: from $r=0.56$ to $0.75$ for individual
         words and from $r=0.60$ to $0.72$ for texts. Importantly, due to the use of
         natural concepts, the ESA model is easy to explain to human users.}
